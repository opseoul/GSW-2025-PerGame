## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [Basketball Reference ‚Äì GSW 2025](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/GSW/2025.html)
- **Format**: Per-game player stats (CSV format)
- **Features include**:

  - Pos: Position
  - MP: Minutes per Game
  - PTS: Points per Game

## üßº Data Cleaning

- Removed the **"Team Totals"** row
- Converted relevant performance columns to numeric
- Created custom efficiency metrics:
  - `Scoring_Efficiency = PTS / FGA`
  - `All_Around_Efficiency = PTS + AST + TRB + STL + BLK`

```python
# Drop team total row
df = df[df["Player"] != "Team Totals"]

# Convert numeric columns
for col in df.columns[3:-2]:
    df[col] = pd.to_numeric(df[col], errors='coerce')
